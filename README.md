# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-ML

This repository contains a simple NLP machine learning model designed to analyze sentiment in Twitter datasets obtained from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The model's primary function is to assess and predict whether the sentiment of a tweet is positive or negative.

During the development of this model, I encountered some challenges with overfitting. I am actively exploring strategies to mitigate this issue to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.
